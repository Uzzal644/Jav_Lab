# Data Types in Java

Data type defines the values that a variable can take, for example if a variable has int data type, it can only take integer values. In java we have two categories of data type:

- Primitive data types
- Non-primitive data types(eg.Arrays and strings) 

## Primitive data types

In Java, we have eight primitive data types: boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double. Java developers included these data types to maintain the portability of java as the size of these primitive data types do not change from one operating system to another.


-byte, short, int and long data types are used for storing whole numbers.

-float and double are used for fractional numbers.

-char is used for storing characters(letters).

-boolean data type is used for variables that holds either true or false.
