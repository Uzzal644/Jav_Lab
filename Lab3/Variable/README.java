# Variables in Java

A variable is a name which is associated with a value that can be changed. For example when I write int i=10; here variable name is i which is associated with value 10, int is a data type that represents that this variable can hold integer values. We will cover the data types in the next tutorial. In this tutorial, we will discuss about variables.

# How to Declare a variable in Java
To declare a variable follow this syntax:

data_type variable_name = value;
here value is optional because in java, you can declare the variable first and then later assign the value to it.

For example: Here num is a variable and int is a data type. We will discuss the data type in next tutorial so do not worry too much about it, just understand that int data type allows this num variable to hold integer values. You can read data types here but I would recommend you to finish reading this guide before proceeding to the next one.
