# Inheritance


The process by which one class acquires the properties(data members) and functionalities(methods) of another class is called inheritance. The aim of inheritance is to provide the reusability of code so that a class has to write only the unique features and rest of the common properties and functionalities can be extended from the another class.
>Child Class:
- The class that extends the features of another class is known as child class, sub class or derived class.

>Parent Class:
- The class whose properties and functionalities are used(inherited) by another class is known as parent class, super class or Base class.

Inheritance is a process of defining a new class based on an existing class by extending its common data members and methods.
Inheritance allows us to reuse of code, it improves reusability in your java application.
Note: The biggest advantage of Inheritance is that the code that is already present in base class need not be rewritten in the child class.

This means that the data members(instance variables) and methods of the parent class can be used in the child class as.
