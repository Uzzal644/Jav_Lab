# Java Package
A package is simply a container that groups related types (Java classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations). For example, in core Java, the ResultSet interface belongs to java.sql package. The package contains all the related types that are needed for SQL query and database connection.

If you want to use ResultSet interface in your code, just import the java.sql package (Importing packages will be discussed later in the article).

As mentioned earlier, packages are just containers for Java classes, interfaces and so on. These packages help you to reserve the class namespace and create maintainable code.

For example, you can find two Date classes in Java. However, the rule of thumb in Java programming is that, only one unique class name is allowed in a Java project.

Based on whether the package is defined by the user or not, packages are divided in two categories:

-Built-in Package
-User-defined Package
